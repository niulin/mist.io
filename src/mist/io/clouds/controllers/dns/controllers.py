"""Cloud DNS Sub-Controllers

A cloud's DNS sub-controller handles all calls to libcloud's DNS API by
subclassing and extending the `BaseDNSController`.

Most often for each different cloud type, there is a corresponding DNS
controller defined here. All the different classes inherit `BaseDBSController`
and share a commmon interface, with the exception that some controllers may
not have implemented all methods. It is also possible that certain cloud types
do not possess their own DNS controller, but rather utilize the base
`BaseDNSController`.

A DNS controller is initialized given a cloud's main controller, which is
derived from `BaseController`. That way, all sub-controllers of a given cloud
will be interconnected at the main controller's level.

Most of the time a sub-controller will be accessed through a cloud's main
controller, using the `ctl` abbreviation, like this:

    cloud = mist.io.clouds.models.Cloud.objects.get(id=cloud_id)
    print cloud.ctl.dns.list_zones()
